## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Stake Amounts
Modify stake ranges in scripts:
```typescript
const minStake = 0.1;  // Minimum STX
const maxStake = 5.0;  // Maximum STX
```

### Transaction Delays
Adjust delays to avoid nonce conflicts:
```typescript
const delayBetweenTx = 3000;  // milliseconds
```

### Block Heights
Customize market timelines:
```typescript
const daysUntilEnd = 30;        // Days until trading closes
const daysUntilResolution = 35; // Days until resolution
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Transaction Fees**: Each transaction requires STX for fees. Ensure sufficient balance.

2. **Nonce Management**: Scripts include delays to prevent nonce conflicts. Adjust if needed.

3. **Block Heights**: Ensure end and resolution blocks are in the future when creating markets.

4. **Rate Limiting**: API calls include delays to avoid rate limiting.

5. **Network**: All scripts default to Stacks Mainnet. Modify for testnet/devnet as needed.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Nonce conflict" errors
- Increase delay between transactions
- Wait for pending transactions to confirm

### "Block height in the past" errors
- Update block height calculations
- Ensure sufficient time until market end/resolution

### "Insufficient balance" errors
- Check STX balance in wallet
- Reduce stake amounts or number of transactions

### API errors
- Check network connectivity
- Verify contract address and name
- Ensure API endpoints are accessible
